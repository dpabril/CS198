I. Using altimeter values or not
A. If we use altimeter
	i. deal with errors(only shows if stationary for a period of time?)
	ii. set ranges to detect if user has reached another floor/level (ranges may vary per building)
	iii. changing of floorplan(how will we implement this?)
	iv. repositioning of user once the user reaches another floor/level
	v. where will the initial location of the destination marker be? how will the position change per floor/level?
	vi. if items i-v are done nicely, ux will be better
	vii. less qr code, less database entries
B. If we don't use the altimeter and use qr codes per floor instead
	i. multiple scans may be done by the user
	ii. changing of floorplan(may be resolved by scanning a new qr code)
	iv. repositioning of user once the user reaches another floor/level(may be resolved by scanning a new qr code)
	v. where will the initial location of the destination marker be? how will the position change per floor/level?
	vi. poor ux, more qr codes->more database entries, easier implementation?
